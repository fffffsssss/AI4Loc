# AI4Loc
Artificial intelligence for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), 
this is a framework for developing deep learning based 3D localization algorithms.

# LUNAR: Localization Using Neural-physics Adaptive Reconstruction
This is the official implementation of the paper 
"Aberration-aware 3D localization microscopy via self-supervised neural-physics learning", 
distributed as a part of the AI4Loc framework.

A brief video introduction to the characteristics of LUNAR:

3. Activate the environment and install the required packages:
```commandline
conda activate ailoc
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run demos:
```commandline
# get into the demos directory
cd demos

## Demos
We recommend testing the code on a work station with an NVIDIA GPU with 24 GB memory, and RAM >= 64 GB.
If such a GPU is unavailable, 
you can reduce the `batch_size` or `context_size` to lower GPU memory usage during training. 
(e.g., `batch_size=1`, `context_size=8`)

We provide several demos in the `demos` directory, illustrating use cases such as beads calibration, 
localization learning based on the calibration, and synchronized learning directly on raw data. 
For all demos: 

* Data should be downloaded from [![img.png](docs/img1.png)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14709467)
 and put in the `datasets` directory.
* Results will be automatically saved in the `results` directory.
* Localizations are saved as a `.csv` file. 

For post-processing and visualizing the localizations, 
We recommend using the [SMAP](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0938-1) software, 
which supports tasks like rendering, filtering, and drift correction, etc.

### Demo 1: Simulated Microtubule Dataset
Demo 1 is based on simulated microtubule datasets with 6 μm Tetrapod PSF. 
You need to download the dataset.
The script `demo1-simu_tubulin_tetra6.py` trains DeepLoc and LUNAR LL with an accurate PSF, followed by LUNAR SL with a wrong PSF. 
All models were trained once with fixed density and tested on three datasets with low, medium, and high densities, respectively. 
Evaluation metrics are automatically printed out after each model's training.

### Demo 2: Experimental Nup96 NPC Dataset
Demo 2 is based on the experimental Nup96 NPC dataset with a 1.2 μm DMO Saddle-Point PSF. 
The dataset and beads for PSF calibration are provided. 
Note that this dataset has ~60 nm y-drift during data acquisition. 

* `demo2.1-psf_calibration.py`: Calibrate the PSF; calibration results are saved along with the beads file.
* `demo2.2-exp_npc_dmo1.2.py`: First train DeepLoc with the calibrated PSF, followed by DeepLoc and LUNAR SL with a wrong astigmatic PSF.

### Demo 3: Whole-Cell Nup96 NPC Dataset
Demo 3 is based on the whole-cell Nup96 NPC dataset with a 6 μm DMO Tetrapod PSF. 
The script `demo3-exp_whole_cell_tetra6.py` trains DeepLoc and LUNAR SL with a mismatched PSF.

### Demo 4: Notebooks with GUI for Demo 2
Demo 4 provides three Jupyter notebooks with graphical user interface (GUI) to demonstrate PSF calibration, model learning, and model inference. 
This demo uses the same data as Demo 2. 
A video `docs/demo4_video_1~1` is provided to show the usage of these notebooks.
